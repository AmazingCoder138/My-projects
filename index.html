          <p>My favorite hobby is coding. I like it because, I get to make productive apps that may help or entartain people someday. I find it fun to see the result from all the hard work. I love to play with my own games and know what's going on in the back end. It's amazing to see what you can make with just a few lines of code. I think coding is  simply stunning, to make things move around, give somone the help they need, and when somone's bored to give them some entertainment. This is why coding is my favorite hobby. </p>
